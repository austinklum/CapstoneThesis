\subsection{Overview} 
This project succeeds in achieving the goal of creating a customizable immersive cultural virtual reality orienteering program. The two programs working in conjunction provide all the functional requirements expected. In addition, the non-functional requirements of being open-sourced, secure, portable, efficient, and easy-to-use have also been kept in mind during development.

\subsection{Challenges}
There were numerous challenges throughout the project. The biggest was the time and effort the developer had available. The developer also worked full-time as a Software Developer II at Kwik Trip. While at times related work as a software developer helped the development of the project, most often the work was unrelated and was a hindrance in terms of time and energy. This set the initial expect completion of Spring 2021, to almost a year and half later, with the actual completion during Summer 2022. \\
\\
Another challenge was the decreased involvement over time of the project sponsor. The project sponsor had a busy workload with other priorities and could not meet often past the initial requirements gathering and early demonstrations. This proved to be challenging as the primary stakeholder's feedback was not taken into consideration as often as an agile process dictates.\\

As the developer was familiar with ASP.NET Core MVC from working experience, the Course Creator program didn't encounter too many hard blockers. The Virtual Reality Orienteering program on the other hand had many hard stops. The developer had no prior experience working with Unity or designing a VR program. The program flow in a game setting is very different than that of a website. The developer had to learn not only how to develop in Unity, but also understand the order of events and processes that enable real-time interaction within the worldspace. In addition, VR development is still not nearly as standardized or mature as web development. Several techniques or solutions tried proved to be ineffective or considered deprecated.   The UI interaction paired with looking around the worldspace took multiple attempts to get right and countless hours to correctly execute. At one point, the developer posted an online listing to pay for a consultant to help solve this issue. Luckily, the developer was able to figure out a solution without the help from a third party.
